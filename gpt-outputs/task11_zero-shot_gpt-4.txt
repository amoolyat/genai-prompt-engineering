Prompt:
Write a prompt that could generate the following prime-checking Python function based on its comment.

`# This function checks if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True`

Model Output:
Prompt: "Generate a Python function that determines if a number is prime."
This basic prompt would lead the model to produce a typical prime-checking function like the one shown.
