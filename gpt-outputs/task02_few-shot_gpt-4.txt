Example:
Input: start = 1, end = 5
Output: 15  # because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

Identify and fix the off-by-one error in the following Python function.

`def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total`


---

Model Output:
The current implementation does not include the `end` value in the sum because Pythonâ€™s `range(start, end)` excludes the end value. To fix the off-by-one error, update the range to go up to `end + 1`.

Corrected function:

def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        total += i
    return total

This ensures that the `end` value is included in the final sum.
