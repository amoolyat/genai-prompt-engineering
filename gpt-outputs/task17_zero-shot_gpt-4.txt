Prompt:
Resolve the inconsistency between this C++ function's name and its logic.

`// Supposed to return true if x is even
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0; // Logic contradicts function name
}`

---

Model Output:
// The function is named isOdd but the logic returns true when x is even.
// To resolve the inconsistency, either:

// Fix the logic:
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 != 0;
}

// Or fix the function name:
bool isEven(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}
You should choose one based on your intended behavior â€” if the function is meant to detect odd numbers, change the logic. If it's supposed to detect even numbers, change the name.
