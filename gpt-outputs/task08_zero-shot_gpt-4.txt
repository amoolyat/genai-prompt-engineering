Prompt:
Improve the given CSV parser to handle quoted fields properly.

`def parse_csv_line(line):
    return line.split(',')  # Incomplete: doesn't handle quoted fields`

---

Model Output:
import csv
import io

def parse_csv_line(line):
    return next(csv.reader(io.StringIO(line)))

# This revised function uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` module to properly handle quoted fields,
# including commas inside quotes, escaped characters, and other edge cases.
