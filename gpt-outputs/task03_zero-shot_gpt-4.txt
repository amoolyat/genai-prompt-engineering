Prompt:
Classify the bug in this C++ function that returns a pointer to a local variable.

`int* getArray(int size) {
    int arr[size]; // Warning: local array
    return arr;    // Bug: returning pointer to local variable
}`

---

Model Output:
This function has a **dangling pointer** bug. It returns a pointer to a local array, which is allocated on the stack. Once the function exits, the memory for the local variable `arr` is no longer valid, and accessing it leads to undefined behavior.

**Bug classification:** Returning a pointer to a stack-allocated (local) variable â€” also known as a **use-after-scope** error.
