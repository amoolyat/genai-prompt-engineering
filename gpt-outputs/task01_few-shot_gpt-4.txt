Example:
Input: ["apple", "banana", "apple"]
Output: {"apple": 2, "banana": 1}

Summarize the functionality of the following Java method that counts word frequencies in a list.

`public Map<String, Integer> countWordFrequency(List<String> words) {
    Map<String, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
    for (String word : words) {
        freqMap.put(word, freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
    }
    return freqMap;
}`

---

Model Output:
This Java method, `countWordFrequency`, takes a list of words as input and returns a map that records how many times each word appears in the list.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
- It creates an empty `HashMap` called `freqMap`.
- It loops through each word in the input list.
- For each word, it uses `getOrDefault` to get the current count (or 0 if the word isn't yet in the map) and increments it by 1.
- It updates the map with this new count.

The method returns the complete frequency map at the end.  
For example, given ["apple", "banana", "apple"], the returned map would be:  
`{"apple": 2, "banana": 1}`
