Prompt:
Complete this Python function to return the average of a list of scores.

`def calculate_average(scores):
    total = 0
    # TODO: Complete to return average
    pass`

---

Model Output:
def calculate_average(scores):
    total = sum(scores)
    return total / len(scores)

# This implementation computes the total using Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum` function
# and divides it by the number of scores to get the average.
