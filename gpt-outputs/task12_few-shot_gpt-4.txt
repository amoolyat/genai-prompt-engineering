Prompt:
Example:
Input: n = 0  
Output: 1

Fix the factorial function to handle input 0 correctly.

`def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        result *= i
    return result`

---

Model Output:
The current function does not correctly return 1 when `n = 0`, because `range(1, 0)` results in an empty loop and skips the multiplication.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

This ensures that the loop runs at least once when `n > 0`, and still returns 1 when `n = 0`, which is the mathematically correct factorial value.
