Prompt:
Break down the logic of this C++ function based on the provided high-level comment.

`// Function that validates input, calculates square, and returns result
int process(int x) {
    if (x < 0) return -1;
    return x * x;
}`

---

Model Output:
1. The function receives an integer input `x`.

2. It first checks if `x` is negative:
   - If `x < 0`, the function returns `-1` immediately. This serves as an input validation step.

3. If the input is valid (i.e., non-negative), the function proceeds to compute `x * x`, which is the square of the input.

4. The squared result is then returned.
