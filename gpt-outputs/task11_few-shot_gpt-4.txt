Prompt:
Example:
Input: A comment that says "This function checks if a number is prime"
Output: A Python function that checks if a number is prime using square root optimization

Write a prompt that could generate the following prime-checking Python function based on its comment.

`# This function checks if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True`

Model Output:
Prompt: "Write a Python function that checks whether a number is prime. Use an efficient approach by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number."
