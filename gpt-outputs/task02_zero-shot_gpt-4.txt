Prompt:
Identify and fix the off-by-one error in the following Python function.

`def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total`

---

Model Output:
The function is intended to return the sum of numbers from `start` to `end`, including both bounds. However, Python's `range(start, end)` excludes the `end` value, resulting in an off-by-one error.

To fix it, change the range to `range(start, end + 1)` so that `end` is included in the sum.

Corrected version:

def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        total += i
    return total
