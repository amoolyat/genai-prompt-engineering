Prompt:
Fix the factorial function to handle input 0 correctly.

`def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        result *= i
    return result`

---

Model Output:
The original function doesn't correctly compute the factorial for n = 0, which should return 1.

To fix this, update the loop range to include `n`:

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

Now the function correctly returns 1 for `n = 0`, since the loop won't execute, and the initial `result = 1` is returned.
