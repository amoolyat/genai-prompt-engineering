Improve the given CSV parser to handle quoted fields properly.

`def parse_csv_line(line):
    return line.split(',')  # Incomplete: doesn't handle quoted fields`

---

Model Output:
import csv
import io

def parse_csv_line(line):
    return next(csv.reader(io.StringIO(line)))

# This implementation uses the built-in csv module,
# which correctly handles quoted fields, commas within quotes, and more.
