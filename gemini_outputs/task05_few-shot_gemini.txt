Example:
Input: GET request to /greet/Alex
Output: {"message": "Hello, Alex!"}

Implement a Flask API endpoint that returns a greeting based on the provided username.

`from flask import Flask, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/greet/<username>')
def greet(username):
    # TODO: Return a JSON greeting
    pass`

---

Model Output:
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/greet/<username>')
def greet(username):
    greeting = {"message": f"Hello, {username}!"}
    return jsonify(greeting)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Explanation:

We import the necessary components from the Flask library: Flask to create the application instance and jsonify to convert a Python dictionary into a JSON response.
app = Flask(__name__) initializes our Flask application.
The @app.route('/greet/<username>') decorator defines the endpoint.
/greet/<username> specifies the URL path. The <username> part is a dynamic placeholder. When a request is made to a URL like /greet/Alice, the value "Alice" will be passed as the username argument to the greet function.
Inside the greet function:
greeting = {"message": f"Hello, {username}!"} creates a Python dictionary with a key "message" and a value that is a greeting string incorporating the username. The f-string makes it easy to embed the username.
return jsonify(greeting) converts this Python dictionary into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response. Flask automatically sets the correct Content-Type header for the response.
The if __name__ == '__main__': block ensures that the Flask development server starts only when the script is run directly. app.run(debug=True) starts the server, and debug=True enables debugging mode, which is helpful during development as it provides more detailed error messages and automatically reloads the server when you make changes to the code.
To run this API:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., app.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the command python app.py.
You can then access the endpoint using a web browser or a tool like curl. For example, to get a greeting for "Alex", you would open http://127.0.0.1:5000/greet/Alex in your browser or run curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/greet/Alex in your terminal. The response will be the JSON:
