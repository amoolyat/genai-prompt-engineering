Prompt:
Summarize the functionality of the following Java method that counts word frequencies in a list.

`public Map<String, Integer> countWordFrequency(List<String> words) {
    Map<String, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
    for (String word : words) {
        freqMap.put(word, freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
    }
    return freqMap;
}`

---

Model Output:
This Java method takes a list of strings as input and returns a map where each unique string in the list is a key, and its corresponding value is the number of times that string appears in the list. It effectively counts the frequency of each word.
