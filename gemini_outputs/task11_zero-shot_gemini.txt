Prompt:
Write a prompt that could generate the following prime-checking Python function based on its comment.

`# This function checks if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True`

---

Model Output:
Based on the Python comment "# This function checks if a number is prime", write a Python function called is_prime that takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is a prime number and False otherwise. Ensure the implementation includes optimizations for efficiency, such as checking divisibility only up to the square root of n.
