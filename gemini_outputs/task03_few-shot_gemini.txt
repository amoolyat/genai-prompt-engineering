Prompt:
Example:
Input: A function that returns a pointer to a local array.
Output: Bug type: Use-after-scope / dangling pointer. Local variables are deallocated once the function returns.

Classify the bug in this C++ function that returns a pointer to a local variable.

`int* getArray(int size) {
    int arr[size]; // Warning: local array
    return arr;    // Bug: returning pointer to local variable
}`

---

Model Output:
Bug type: Use-after-scope / dangling pointer. Local variables, such as the array arr in this function, are deallocated from the stack once the getArray function completes its execution. Returning a pointer to this deallocated memory results in a dangling pointer, and any attempt to access the memory it points to will lead to undefined behavior.
