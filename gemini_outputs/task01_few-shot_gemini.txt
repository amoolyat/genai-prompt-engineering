Prompt:
Example:
Input: ["apple", "banana", "apple"]
Output: {"apple": 2, "banana": 1}

Summarize the functionality of the following Java method that counts word frequencies in a list.

`public Map<String, Integer> countWordFrequency(List<String> words) {
    Map<String, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
    for (String word : words) {
        freqMap.put(word, freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
    }
    return freqMap;
}`

---

Model Output:

That Java method efficiently tallies the occurrences of each unique word within a given list of strings. It iterates through the list, and for each word, it updates a frequency map. If the word is encountered for the first time, it's added to the map with a count of 1. If the word has already been seen, its corresponding count in the map is incremented by 1. Finally, the method returns the map containing each unique word as a key and its frequency as the value.
