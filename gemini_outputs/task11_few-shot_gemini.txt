Prompt:
Example:
Input: A comment that says "This function checks if a number is prime"
Output: A Python function that checks if a number is prime using square root optimization

Write a prompt that could generate the following prime-checking Python function based on its comment.

`# This function checks if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True`

---

Model Output:
Generate a Python function that adheres to the following comment: "# This function checks if a number is prime" and implement it with an efficient approach, such as using the square root for optimization.
