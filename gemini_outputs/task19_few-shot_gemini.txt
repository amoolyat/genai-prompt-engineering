Prompt:
Example:
Input: A function that returns -1 if input is negative, else returns square of input  
Output: Step 1: Check if input is negative  
        Step 2: If so, return -1  
        Step 3: Else, return square of input

Break down the logic of this C++ function based on the provided high-level comment.

`// Function that validates input, calculates square, and returns result
int process(int x) {
    if (x < 0) return -1;
    return x * x;
}`

Model Output:
Let's break down the logic of the C++ function process(int x) step by step, considering the function's code and the high-level comment provided:

High-Level Comment: "// Function that validates input, calculates square, and returns result"

Code Analysis:

C++

int process(int x) {
    if (x < 0) return -1;
    return x * x;
}
Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Function Definition: The code defines a function named process that takes a single integer argument, x, and is declared to return an integer value.

Input Validation (as implied by the comment): The first line within the function, if (x < 0), performs a check on the input value x. This can be interpreted as a form of input validation. The function is examining whether the input integer is negative.

Conditional Return (Negative Input): If the condition x < 0 evaluates to true (meaning the input x is indeed negative), the function immediately executes the statement return -1;. This indicates that for negative input values, the function returns the integer value -1. This could be interpreted as an error code or a specific value indicating an invalid input according to the function's implicit validation rule.

Conditional Return (Non-Negative Input) and Calculation: If the condition x < 0 evaluates to false (meaning the input x is not negative; it is either zero or positive), the function proceeds to the next line: return x * x;. This line calculates the square of the input integer x by multiplying it by itself. The result of this calculation is then returned by the function. This part aligns with the comment's mention of "calculates square" and "returns result".

In summary, the function process(int x) performs the following logic:

It takes an integer x as input.
It checks if x is negative.
If x is negative, it returns -1.
If x is not negative (i.e., zero or positive), it calculates the square of x and returns that value.
The high-level comment accurately reflects the function's behavior: it implicitly validates the input by treating negative numbers specially, it calculates the square of the input for non-negative numbers, and it returns a result based on these operations.
