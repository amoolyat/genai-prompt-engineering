Prompt:
Identify and fix the off-by-one error in the following Python function.

`def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total`

---

Model Output:
def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        total += i
    return total
Now, range(start, end + 1) will generate numbers from start up to and including end, ensuring that the final value in the range is added to the total.
