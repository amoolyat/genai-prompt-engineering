Prompt:
Finish the Python class constructor by adding name, age, and an optional email field.

`class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Add name, age, and optional email
        pass`

---

Model Output:
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, email=None):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.email = email
Explanation:

The __init__ method is the constructor of the Person class. It's called automatically when you create a new Person object.
We've added three parameters to the constructor:
name: This parameter is required and will be used to initialize the self.name attribute.
age: This parameter is also required and will initialize the self.age attribute.
email: This parameter is optional. It has a default value of None. If you provide an email address when creating a Person object, it will be assigned to self.email; otherwise, self.email will be None.
Inside the constructor, we use self.attribute_name = parameter_name to assign the values passed during object creation to the instance's attributes.
