Complete this Python function to return the average of a list of scores.

`def calculate_average(scores):
    total = 0
    # TODO: Complete to return average
    pass`

---

Model Output:
Explanation:

Initialization: The function starts by initializing a variable total to 0. This variable will accumulate the sum of all the scores in the list.

Handling Empty List: The if not scores: condition checks if the input list scores is empty. If it is, attempting to calculate the average would lead to a ZeroDivisionError. To handle this gracefully, the function returns 0.0 in the case of an empty list. This is a common way to manage such scenarios, though you might choose to raise an exception or return a different value depending on the specific requirements of your application.

Iterating Through Scores: The for score in scores: loop iterates through each element in the scores list. In each iteration, the current score is added to the total.

Calculating the Average: After the loop has processed all the scores, the average is calculated by dividing the total sum by the number of scores in the list, which is obtained using len(scores).

Returning the Average: Finally, the calculated average is returned by the function. The return value will be a floating-point number, even if all the input scores are integers, to ensure accurate representation of the average.
