Prompt:
Example:  
Input: "Hello, world! Hello."  
Output: {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}

Complete this Python file-processing script to clean punctuation and count word frequencies robustly.

`import string
def load_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.readlines()

def clean_line(line):
    # TODO: Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    pass

def count_words(lines):
    word_counts = {}
    for line in lines:
        clean = clean_line(line)
        for word in clean.split():
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

def main():
    filepath = 'input.txt'
    lines = load_file(filepath)
    counts = count_words(lines)
    for word, count in sorted(counts.items()):
        print(f"{word}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':

Explanation of the Completed Code:

load_file(filepath):

Includes error handling using a try-except block to catch FileNotFoundError and other potential reading errors.
Specifies encoding='utf-8' when opening the file to handle a wider range of characters correctly.
Returns an empty list if the file cannot be read.
clean_line(line):

Imports the re (regular expression) module for more efficient punctuation removal.
Uses re.sub(r'[' + string.punctuation + ']', '', line) to replace all occurrences of punctuation characters (defined in string.punctuation) with an empty string.
Converts the resulting string to lowercase using .lower() to ensure consistent word counting (e.g., "Hello" and "hello" are counted as the same word).
count_words(lines):

Iterates through each line in the input lines list.
Calls clean_line() to remove punctuation and convert the line to lowercase.
Uses cleaned_line.split() to split the line into a list of individual words based on whitespace.
Iterates through each word in the words list.
Uses word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1 to efficiently update the count of each word in the word_counts dictionary. If the word is not already in the dictionary, get(word, 0) returns 0, and then 1 is added to initialize the count.
main():

Prompts the user to enter the filepath of the text file.
Calls load_file() to read the lines from the specified file.
Checks if lines is not empty (meaning the file was read successfully).
Calls count_words() to get the word frequencies.
Iterates through the counts dictionary (sorted alphabetically by word using sorted(counts.items())) and prints each word along with its count in the format "word: count".
To use this script:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., word_counter.py).
Create a text file named input.txt (or any name you prefer) in the same directory as the script, containing the text you want to analyze.
Run the script from your terminal: python word_counter.py
When prompted, enter the name of your text file (e.g., input.txt).
The script will then print the word frequencies, sorted alphabetically.
