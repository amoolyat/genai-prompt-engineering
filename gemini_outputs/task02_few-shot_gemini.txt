Prompt:
Example:
Input: start = 1, end = 5
Output: 15  # because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

Identify and fix the off-by-one error in the following Python function.

`def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total`

---

Model Output:
Here's the corrected version of the function:

Python

def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        total += i
    return total
By changing range(start, end) to range(start, end + 1), the loop will now include the end value in the summation, giving you the correct result. For your example with start = 1 and end = 5, the corrected function will indeed return 15.
