Prompt:
Resolve the inconsistency between this C++ function's name and its logic.

`// Supposed to return true if x is even
bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x % 2 == 0; // Logic contradicts function name
}`

---

Model Output:
The function name isOdd is inconsistent with its logic, which returns true if x is even. To resolve this, either the name should be changed to isEven, or the logic should be modified to return x % 2 != 0; to correctly check for odd numbers. Given the comment, the best fix is to rename the function to isEven.
